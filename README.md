# KryptoBot
English | [正體中文](https://github.com/Nootm/KryptoBot/README_ZHT.md)

Trading bot to be used with TradingView and Bybit, like WunderTrading.
## Features:
- Fully self-hosted.
- Easy to set up with either an existing email account (webhook mode) or a public IP address (mailbox mode).
- Don't rely on 3rd party services, only connections with Bybit and the specified SMTP server (if you use mailbox mode) would be made.
- GUI mode and headless mode provided.
- I don't have a Windows machine, so run it on a VPS if you use Windows.
