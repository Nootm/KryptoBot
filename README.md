Trading bot to be used with TradingView and Bybit, like WunderTrading.
Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any of your losses using this program. This project is still in early stages, so do test it using [Bybit Testnet](https://testnet.bybit.com/en-US/) for at least a week before using it.
## Features:
- Fully self-hosted.
- Easy to set up with either an existing email account (webhook mode) or a public IP address (mailbox mode).
- Don't rely on 3rd party services, only connections with Bybit and the specified SMTP server (if you use mailbox mode) would be made.
- GUI mode and headless mode provided.
- I don't have a Windows rig to test, so run it on VPS or [a virtual machine with Linux](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/) if you use Windows.
