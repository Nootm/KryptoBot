# KryptoBot
[English](https://github.com/Nootm/KryptoBot/README.md)[正體中文](https://github.com/Nootm/KryptoBot/README_ZHT.md)
Trading bot to be used with TradingView and Bybit, like WunderTrading.
# Features:
- Fully self-hosted.
- Easy to set up with either an existing email account or a public IP address.
- Don't rely on 3rd party services, only connections with Bybit and the specified SMTP server (if you use mailbox mode) would be made.
